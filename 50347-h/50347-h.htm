<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This little book should be used as a simple guide to
the practical study of Nature rather than as a mere reader.</p>
<p>Every lesson herein set down has, during the author&rsquo;s
many years&rsquo; experience in teaching Nature Study, been
taught by observation and practice again and again; and
each time with satisfactory result. The materials
required for most of the lessons&mdash;whether they be obtained
from the naturalist-dealer or from the nearest hedge,
ditch, or pond&mdash;are within everybody&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>There is nothing that appeals to the heart of the
ordinary child like <i>living things</i>, be they animal or
vegetable, and there is no branch of education at the
present day that bears, in the young mind, such excellent
fruit as the study of the simple, living things around us.</p>
<p>Your child is nothing if not curious. He wants to
understand everything that lives and moves and has its
being in his bright little world.</p>
<p>Nature Study involves so many ingenious little deductions,
that the reasoning powers are almost constantly
employed, and intelligence grows proportionately. The
child&rsquo;s powers of observation are stimulated, and his
memory is cultivated in the way most pleasing to his
inquiring nature. By dissecting seeds, bulbs, buds, and
flowers, his hand is trained, and methods expeditious
and exact are inculcated. By drawing his specimens,
no matter how roughly or rapidly, his eye is trained
more thoroughly than any amount of enforced copying
of stiff, uninteresting models of prisms, cones, etc., ever
could train it.</p>
<p>The love of flowers and animals is one of the most
commendable traits in the disposition of the wondering
child, and ought to be encouraged above all others.</p>
<p>It is the author&rsquo;s fondest and most sanguine hope that
the working out of the exercises, of which this booklet
is mainly composed, may prove much more of a joy than
a task, and that the practical knowledge gained thereby
may tempt his little readers to study further the great
book of Nature, whose broad pages are ever open to us,
and whose silent answers to our manifold questions are
never very difficult to read.</p>

<h1 title="">&ldquo;LOOK ABOUT YOU.&rdquo;
<br /><span class="small">BOOK IV.</span></h1>
<h2 id="c1">I.&mdash;STRUCTURE OF STEMS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have a peep into the inside of these
twigs,&rdquo; said Uncle George, as he laid some willow and
horse-chestnut twigs on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us examine the outside of them.&rdquo;
He handed a small willow branch to Tom and a horse-chestnut
branch to Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Frank, tell me all you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the rings of scars which mark each year&rsquo;s
growth,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s growth is at the top,
above the first ring of scars. Below this is last year&rsquo;s
growth. Then comes another ring of marks, and below
this again is the growth of two years ago.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;the upper part of
your twig is about one year old, the middle part is two
years old, and the lower part is three years old. Go on,
Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The upper part is light brown, while the middle and
lower parts are dark brown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take your lens, Frank, and look at that brown
covering carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is studded all over with
little oval marks like pits,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what about the buds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The buds,&rdquo; said Frank, putting
down his lens, &ldquo;are in pairs; and
the stem is swollen where each pair
of buds comes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;That is exactly what I wanted you
to notice. The swollen parts of a
stem are called its <i>nodes</i>. In every
stem, buds and leaves occur at the
nodes. Nodes are very well seen in
grass and corn stems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then at the top of the twig
there is a very large bud and a pair
of small buds, one on each side of
it,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have described it very well,&rdquo;
said his uncle. &ldquo;Now, Tom, what
about the willow twig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see some very tiny marks on
it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;There are no rings
marking the year&rsquo;s growth; and the
buds are not arranged in pairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/illus011.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="599" />
<p class="caption">Horse-Chestnut Twig, showing Three Years&rsquo; Growth.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite right, Tom. Willow grows very
quickly. Your twig is all one season&rsquo;s growth. It is
smooth and green&mdash;not brown like the horse-chestnut
twig. The buds are arranged alternately. That is to
say, there is only one bud at each node.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let us see what the horse-chestnut twig is
made of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George next cut two pieces off the top part of
the horse-chestnut twig and handed one to each of the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, take your knives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and carefully peel
off a very small piece of the brown covering. You will
have to be very careful, as it is very thin and rather
difficult to remove. Ah, Frank, you have done that very
nicely. Now, hold it up to the light and tell us what
you think it is for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the skin or covering of the twig,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is; and if you look with your lens you will see that
the tiny markings on it are holes. It is really a thin layer
of bark or cork. Perhaps you can tell me why the twig
is covered with a thin layer of cork?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep water from getting in,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather to keep water from getting <i>out</i>,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;You must remember that water is continually
passing up stems from the roots. Water cannot pass
through cork. If we were to remove the cork layer from
the outside of a growing twig, that twig would shrivel
up and die. There is also a layer of cork protecting the
willow twig, but it is so very thin that we can see through
it. Remove as much of the cork layer as you can, and
tell me what is underneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a layer of green stuff beneath,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Now, if you remember,
I once told you that plants took most of their food from
the air by means of the green stuff in their leaves. This
green layer in the twig does the same thing; but how
can the air get in if it is covered up by a layer of cork?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see now,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;what the tiny holes or
pits are for&mdash;to let air in to the green layer underneath.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/illus013.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="493" />
<p class="caption">Diagram Sections of (A and B) a One-Year Old and (C and D) Two-Year Old Stem.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Bark.</dt>
<dt>2. Green Layer.</dt>
<dt>3. Bast.</dt>
<dt>4. Slippery Layer.</dt>
<dt>5. Wood.</dt>
<dt>6. Pith.</dt></dl></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what they are for, Tom,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;Scrape away this green layer. It is greenest on the
outside and is rather thick. There are really two or three
layers there, but they cannot be separated with a pen-knife.
What do you come to next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A white, woody layer with a very slippery surface,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That slippery surface is itself a layer, and a very
important one,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;The wood, you can see,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
is a very thick layer. In the centre you have a mass of
dry, spongy stuff. This is called the pith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then cut the twig straight across, and
the boys saw that each layer formed a ring. In the
middle there was a round mass of pith. Around this
was a thick ring of wood with the thin slippery layer
outside. Outside this was a fairly thick ring, the outer
half of which was green in colour. And outside the whole
lot was the ring of the thin bark or cork which the boys
had first examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;how a one-year-old
stem is built. Let us now make a clean cut
through the two-year-old part of the twig, and another
through the three-year-old part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see there are two rings of wood in the two-year-old
part and three rings of wood in the three-year-old
part. What does this show us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a ring of wood is added every year,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, three years ago, this thick branch was a
tiny bud,&rdquo; said Uncle George, pointing to the lower part
of the twig.</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson I.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. An apple will keep sound for months if the skin is unbroken. If we remove a small piece of the skin, the apple soon shrivels up. How is this?</dt>
<dt>2. Can you explain why we ought not to eat the outer skins of the plum, grape, tomato, pear, etc.?</dt>
<dt>3. Cut a stout twig of any tree straight through. Make a rough sketch showing the different layers, and tell how old the twig is.</dt>
<dt>4. Get stout twigs of different trees, such as ash, elm, holly, sycamore. Take about an inch length of each. Split these down the centre, and see if you can make out the different layers on each side of the pith. Make an enlarged drawing of one of these.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c2">II.&mdash;BULBS AND CORMS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;are what we grow our
snowdrops and crocuses from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he handed each of the boys a few hard,
round objects. Some of these were small, white, and
almost pear-shaped. The others were larger, rounder,
and brown in colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The small white ones are snowdrop <b><i>bulbs</i></b>,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;The others are crocus <b><i>corms</i></b>. There is a great
difference between a bulb and a corm, as we shall see
when we examine and compare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The corm is covered with brown, papery skins, and
has white buds on the top of it,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These brown skins are leaves,&rdquo; remarked Uncle
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaves?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I thought all leaves were
green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Tom, there are other leaves besides green
leaves, called scale-leaves. Green leaves, as you know,
give off the moisture which the roots take up from the
soil. They also take in plant-food from the air. Scale-leaves
protect buds, flowers, and tender stems from cold
and from insects. These thin brown leaves of the crocus
corm are scale-leaves formed underground. Please
remove the brown scale-leaves from one of the corms,
Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>When Frank had done so, it was seen that these
leaves were attached in layers all round the corm. The
corm was now a white, rounded lump. The removal of
the scale-leaves had left thin rings of leaf-marks; and
on these leaf-marks, here and there a tiny bud was seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;we can see that a corm
is a stout, swollen, underground stem. If you could
imagine a horse-chestnut
stem to be squeezed up
into a lump, you would
have something like a
corm. These rings of leaf-marks
are the nodes, where
leaves and buds are found
on all stems. The large
buds on the top of the
corm correspond to the
large buds at the end of
your horse-chestnut stem.
Now, let us take off one
of these large top buds.
Notice that it is covered
with many tough, protective
scale-leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Removing these scales,
Uncle George came to a
round object in the centre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a long sack or bag. It contains
the flower of the crocus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a needle, he carefully opened this up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take your magnifiers and look
carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank and Tom looked, and saw a curious little
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
flower, surrounded by four or five yellow needle-shaped
things which, their uncle told them, were the young green
leaves of the crocus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;examine the snowdrop bulb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we have thick, fleshy scale-leaves. If we remove
them one by one, we find that they are all attached to
a flat, button-shaped stem. Between the thick scale-leaves
we see, here and there, a small side bud, and
on the top the baby snowdrop flower snugly wrapped
up in their sack. This protective sack is called a
<b><i>spathe</i></b>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then took from his pocket a very large
bulb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the bulb of the narcissus or
&lsquo;white lily.&rsquo; It is almost exactly like the snowdrop bulb,
but it is larger, so that we can see things much more
distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then split the large bulb down the centre with his
knife. With a pin he pointed out the baby flower
wrapped up in its spathe. All the parts of the flower
were seen, even the little seed-vessel containing the
tiny eggs, which become seeds after the flower has
grown up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you remember,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;in our lesson
on seeds we learned that a seed contained a baby plant
and a large supply of plant-food. I am now going to
show you that both the corm and the bulb contain a large
food supply. We have seen that the protective bud-scales
in the corm are tough and thin, while the stem is
swollen and hard. In the bulb, on the other hand, the
bud-scales are thick and fleshy, while the stem is flat
and very small. If we place some of our crocus corms
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
or snowdrop bulbs in pure water, they will grow and
flower just as well as if we had planted them in the
garden. What does this show us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, like the seeds which we grew in water, bulbs
and corms contain a store of food,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is correct, Frank. Let us put a corm and a
bulb in water. Let us also plant one of each in a pot
of soil. We will watch them growing and compare them
from week to week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am going to show you a simple experiment.
You know that the food we eat is drawn largely from
plants. This food which we take from the plant world
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
is chiefly what the chemist calls <i>starch</i>. We have it in
bread, potatoes, rice, cornflour, and in nearly all the
vegetables we eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have here in this bottle a substance, called <i>iodine</i>,
dissolved in water. Anything containing <i>starch</i> turns
blue when touched with iodine. Now observe what
happens here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George poured some of the iodine into a saucer.
He then dipped into the iodine a piece of crocus corm,
a thick scale of the snowdrop bulb, soaked seeds of maize
and wheat, a slice of raw potato, and a piece of bread.
Each at once turned dark blue on being dipped into the
liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what do you learn from this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food store in bulbs and corms is the same as
that in seeds,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food supply of the bulb is contained in the thick,
fleshy scale-leaves, while in the corm it is in the stem,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;It also shows us,
I think, that we ourselves owe a great deal to the plant
world.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson II.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Split an onion (or tulip bulb) down the centre, and compare it with the snowdrop bulb. Draw it, giving special attention to the middle part.</dt>

<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c3">III.&mdash;WHAT GOES ON INSIDE A PLANT.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen how an ordinary twig is built up,&rdquo;
said Uncle George. &ldquo;Let us now try to find out what
goes on inside the twig; and in order to do this we shall
have to perform one or two simple experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George took two wide-mouthed glass jars.
They were both perfectly dry, and each could be closed
with a large, tight-fitting cork. He placed some fresh
green leaves inside one of the jars. The other remained
empty. Then both jars were tightly corked up, and both
corks covered outside with wax.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/illus022.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="411" />
<p class="caption">First Experiment.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is experiment number one,&rdquo; he said, as he
placed both jars in the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>He next took a small plant which was growing in a
pot. He wrapped the pot up in thick, dry paper, so that
the paper covered up everything
but the plant. The
edges of the paper were
tied tightly round the
lower part of the stem of
the plant with a string.
The plant was put in the
window, and over it Uncle
George placed a glass
bell-jar.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Second Experiment.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The third experiment
is much simpler,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You see I just put one
of the willow twigs into a
glass half filled with water,
and into the water I pour
some red ink. Frank,
place a white pansy in the
coloured water beside the
willow twig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George&rsquo;s fourth
experiment was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>He placed four willow
twigs in a glass of water.
But from two of these
twigs he first removed a broad ring of the bark and
outer layers, leaving about an inch of the wood bare
near the lower end of the twig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will come back in about an
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
hour, and I think we shall find that some change has
taken place in each of our first three jars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth glass one will have to be left for several
weeks; and we must take care to keep water always in
the glass containing these four twigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About an hour afterwards, Uncle George and the boys
came to look at the experiments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us examine experiment one first,&rdquo; said Uncle
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The empty jar is just the same as when we put it
there,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The jar containing the leaves is all
dimmed, and there are tiny drops of water on the inside
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that water come from, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have come out of the leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so! Now look at the second experiment,
and you will see that the bell-jar which covered both
plant and pot is also dimmed with moisture. Pot and
soil were securely covered up, so that this moisture on
the glass must have come from the leaves of the plant.
Where do you think this water really comes from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the soil in the pot,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;If we did
not water those plants which we keep in pots, they
would die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have learnt that water travels up the stems
of plants,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;also that it is drawn
from the soil and is given off by the leaves. The third
experiment, where we placed a twig in coloured water,
will, I think, show us which part of the stem the water
travels up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George peeled the bark off the lower end of the
willow twig which was placed in the mixture of red ink
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
and water. He removed all the layers until he came to
the wood. The wood was stained red. He cut slice after
slice off the twig, and it was found that the coloured
water had gone quite an inch up through the wood.
None of the other layers of the twig were stained
red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It travels up through
the wood-layer,&rdquo; said
Frank. &ldquo;And look at the
pansy flower. It was
white when we put it into
the glass, now it is all
streaked with red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flower itself,&rdquo;
said Uncle George, &ldquo;is not
near the coloured water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water must have
travelled up the long stalk
to the flower,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/illus025.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="601" />
<p class="caption">The Fourth Experiment.</p>
</div>
<p>The fourth experiment
was left in the window,
and two or three weeks
passed before any change
was noticed in any of the
four twigs which had been
placed in the water. Then
roots began to grow. In
the two whole twigs these
roots grew out at the bottom end. But in those twigs
from which the belt of outer layers had been removed,
it was quite different. Here the roots grew out&mdash;not at
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the bottom, but just where the ring of bare wood began
and at the top of it.</p>
<p>Frank and Tom were quite puzzled. They could
not understand why the roots should come at the
bottom in two of the twigs and not in the other
two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, then,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;these new
roots were made from materials which came from inside
the plant. These building materials are carried through
the plant dissolved in water&mdash;just as you dissolve sugar
in your tea. Water containing these dissolved stuffs in
a plant is called <i>sap</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen, by our first three experiments, that
water travels up the wood part of the stem. This experiment
shows us that sap travels <i>down</i> the stem in
the layers outside the wood. For, when I removed
the outer layers and left a bare ring of wood, the flow
of the sap was stopped and the new roots formed
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where does this sap come from first of all?&rdquo;
Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really formed in the leaf first of all. I think I
told you that plants take most of their food from the air
by means of their green leaves. In the great quantities
of water which pass up the wood and into the air from
the leaves there is always a very little mineral matter
dissolved. This small quantity of mineral matter comes
from the soil. This, along with water and the large
quantity of matter taken from the air, are changed, inside
the leaf, into a fluid which we call sap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our four experiments show us that water travels up
through the wood-layer from soil to leaf; and also that
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
sap travels down through one of the outside layers of
the stem.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Questions on Lesson III.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. How does water travel in a plant? How can you prove this?</dt>
<dt>2. If we enclose a leafy plant in a glass vessel, we see that water is given off by the leaves. How is it that we do not see this water when the plant is grown in the open air?</dt>
<dt>3. What is &ldquo;sap&rdquo;? Where is it first formed? How does it travel in the twig or stem?</dt>
<dt>4. If we keep ferns growing under a glass bell&mdash;or in a glass case&mdash;we never have to water them. Can you explain this?</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV.&mdash;SNOWDROP, CROCUS, AND TULIP.</h2>
<p>The boys watched the growth of the crocuses in water
and in soil from day to day, and made sketches of them
once a week. Fed by the food contained in the corm,
the top buds of the crocus grew longer. Then the
scales moved apart and the yellow flower was seen.
Round about it were four or five narrow green leaves,
each having a pretty white stripe down the middle.
Both leaves and flower were encircled at the base by
long white sheaths.</p>
<p>The crocus grown in the pot did not seem to thrive
much better than the one in the water. Both flowers
remained closed for a long time after they were full
grown.</p>
<p>At last, on one fine sunny day, they opened out wide
at the top, and the boys could see right down into them.
In the evening they closed up again. Next day was a
dull day, and the crocus flowers remained closed.</p>
<p>The snowdrops were also watched and sketched.
Their growth was somewhat different. From the centre
of the little bulb two green leaves first appeared. These
leaves were much broader and thicker than those of the
crocus. From between these leaves a little white, flat
object grew up. This the boys at once recognised as
the spathe or bag containing the flower. Then more
green leaves came up. The flower-stalk grew longer.
The spathe split open, and the flower-bud appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>This bud grew until it became a beautiful white bell
hanging downwards.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/illus029a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="680" />
<p class="caption">Crocus Flowers.</p>
</div>
<p>In a large pot Uncle George had planted a few tulip
bulbs. They were not completely covered with soil, so
that their growth could be watched. Their growth was
similar to that of the snowdrop. The leaves came first.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
They were rolled firmly round each other. As each
large, broad, green leaf unrolled, another rolled-up leaf
was seen under it. These leaves were rolled round a
thick stalk, to which they were attached. When the
last leaf unrolled, a single flower was seen at the top of
the stalk. This flower remained closed up like the
crocus. When at length, however, the warm sun shone
in the window, the tulip flowers opened out very wide
indeed; in fact, they became almost saucer-shaped.</p>
<p>Then Uncle George dug the snowdrop and crocus
out of their pots. He washed the roots and asked the
boys to compare them with those grown in water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plants grown in soil seem stronger in flower
and leaves,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;But the greatest difference
is in the corm and bulb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right, Frank,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;Look
at the crocus corms. They have both shrunk a great
deal, because they have been used up to form what has
grown out of them. But the one grown in soil has
formed a new corm, which will produce new flowers
next year. This new corm has grown upon the top of
the old one. The crocus grown in water has also produced
a new corm, but it is too small to produce a
flower next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, again, take the snowdrop. The one grown
in the soil has produced two or three new bulbs, while
that grown in water has not. These new bulbs were
the side buds we noticed between the scales when we
opened out our snowdrop bulb. In both snowdrops the
old bulb has been completely used up to form green
leaves and flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bulb grown in soil has not only produced
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
flowers and green leaves. It has gathered up enough
material from soil and air to form new bulbs for next
year.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Uncle George then divided the crocus flower with his
knife from top to bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the very bottom of the flower,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you see
the ovary, or seed-vessel, containing the tiny seeds.
From the seed-vessel a long thin rod or tube stretches
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
to the very mouth of the flower. You can also see the
remains of the spathe which once enclosed the whole
flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are those three things covered with
orange-coloured dust?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;are the stamens or pollen-boxes;
and the orange-coloured powder is the pollen.
This pollen is carried about from flower to flower
by the bees. Pollen is necessary for the production
of seeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why the seed-vessel of the crocus is
so far down under the ground?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because the crocus flowers in winter-time, and
the frost might kill the young seeds. Underground they
are safe from frost. The snowdrop is a hardy flower,
and, besides, the walls of its seed-vessel are very thick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tulip, if grown outside, flowers much later than
the other two plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice the difference between the flower of the tulip
and those of either crocus or snowdrop. Its petals are
all separate, while those of the others are joined to form
a bell or tube. The seed-vessel of the tulip, also, stands
right up in the centre of the flower, while that of the
snowdrop (and crocus) is placed underneath the flower
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it, Uncle George, that the flowers of both
tulip and crocus open out wide when the sun shines
and close when the sun goes down?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plants can feel to a certain extent,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;That is to say, they are affected by heat and
cold, by light and shade. A great many flowers close
up at night&mdash;the daisy, for instance; and have you never
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
noticed how clover leaves fold up long before night
comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but why should the crocus and tulip open and
close? The snowdrop never closes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do so to protect their pollen,&rdquo; his uncle
answered. &ldquo;Rain or dew would ruin pollen. Those
flowers, like the crocus and tulip, which open out to the
sky must close up, or the precious pollen would be
destroyed. Flowers like the snowdrop and bluebell,
which hang downwards, have no need to close up, for
their pollen is under a roof of joined petals.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson IV.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Place an onion or daffodil bulb in the mouth of a bottle containing water. Keep it in the dark for about ten days. Then place it in the window. Make sketches every week.</dt>
<dt>2. Make a list of all the plants you know which close their flowers, or fold up their leaves, at night.</dt>
<dt>3. Cut open a flower of the daffodil (or narcissus), also one of the wallflower. Draw both, naming their parts. What points of difference do you notice in the two flowers?</dt>
<dt>4. Examine the following flowers, and see if you can find where the young seeds are:&mdash;Hyacinth, primrose, violet (or pansy), chickweed, Christmas rose, shepherd&rsquo;s purse.</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c5">V.&mdash;VEGETABLE FINGERS.</h2>
<p>When the sweet-peas in the garden were nearly full
grown, Uncle George sowed some sweet-peas in a
pot. In a fortnight those sown in the pot were about
four inches in height, and those in the garden were in
flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go into the garden, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
see if we can learn something from the sweet-pea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the garden the sweet-peas were really lovely.
They looked, as Frank said, like so many beautiful
butterflies on the wing; and they filled the air with
delicious perfume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;that our row of sweet-peas
is by far the best thing in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true, Frank,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;but it
is not so much the flowers we are going to study at
present. The sweet-pea is certainly one of our finest
flowering plants. It is also one of the most interesting.
Can you tell me why we put stakes up for our sweet-pea
plants to cling to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they have long, slender stems&mdash;too slender
and weak to grow up by themselves,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Frank. If the sweet-pea were a wild
plant, where would it grow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hedges,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right again,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;If we grow the
sweet-pea in the garden, we must imitate its surroundings
in the wild state&mdash;we must give it a hedge of some
kind to cling to, otherwise it would trail along the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would get choked among the other plants,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;<i>choked</i>,&rsquo; Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would die for want of air&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And light,&rdquo; his uncle added. &ldquo;No green plant can
live without air and sunlight; and, in order to get these,
our weak-stemmed sweet-pea has to climb. It clings to
its stronger brethren just as the wild peas do in the
hedgerow. Now notice how it climbs. The end part of
each leaf consists of little gripping organs called
tendrils. These twine tightly round the smallest twigs
near them.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a rose leaf. It is composed of several
leaflets, and at its base there are two small, brownish-green
things called <i>stipules</i>. If we compare this
leaf with the leaf of the sweet-pea, we find that in
some points they are similar, but in others very
different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rose leaf is called a compound leaf, because it
is made up of many small leaflets. The sweet-pea leaf
is also a compound leaf, but it has only two leaflets,
and these are of enormous size. The rose leaf has two
small stipules. The stipules of the sweet-pea leaf are
large and green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I place the rose leaf beside a sweet-pea leaf, you
will notice that the latter has <i>no upper leaflets</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has tendrils &lsquo;instead,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;These tendrils
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
correspond to leaflets. Now, if the plant has been
forced to turn all its leaflets, except two, into gripping
organs, how does it manage to make up for this loss of
green leaves?</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/illus039.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="599" />
<p class="caption">Young Edible Pea.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have already learned
that plants take in food from
the air by means of the green
substance in their leaves. The
more of this green substance
a plant possesses, the more
food it can take in from the
air. If it sacrifices leaves in
order to climb up to the light
and air, its amount of the green
material must be lessened. But
the sweet-pea makes up for
this loss of leaves. Can you
see how it does so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stipules are very
large,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lower part of the
leaf-stalk is very flat, broad,
and green,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle
George, &ldquo;but look at the long,
slender stem. It has flat,
green, ribbon-like outgrowths
on each side throughout its
whole length. So, you see, what the plant loses in
leaves, it makes up in another way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now look at the ordinary pea plant. Its leaf
has four pairs of leaflets and three pairs of tendrils
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
besides the terminal tendril&mdash;seven tendrils altogether.
The stipules here are also very large&mdash;much larger
than those of the sweet-pea. But the stem is round
and smooth. There are no green outgrowths. Here is
a wild pea, which I found to-day, which has no leaves
at all. All its leaflets have been turned into tendrils or
gripping organs. But look at the enormous stipules it
has! They are much bigger than ordinary pea leaves.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/illus040.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="339" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>A Wild Pea with no Leaves.</dt>
<dt>Young Sweet-Peas have no Tendrils.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now look at the tendrils of the sweet-pea,
and see how they grip their supports. Notice that they
begin to twist long before they reach the supporting
twig. Then, when they have reached it, they twist round
it <i>in the opposite way</i>&mdash;just like a piece of string, if you
twist it at one end, it untwists at the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see any reason for this coiling before it
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
reaches the twig?&rdquo; As he spoke, Uncle George pulled a
sweet-pea plant out from its supports, and the boys saw
that the tendril was really a spiral spring. The plant
could be pulled out a considerable length without
breaking the tendril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Uncle George continued, &ldquo;if it were not for
that first coiling of the tendril&mdash;that is to say, if the tendril
grew out straight and only began to twist when it
reached the twig&mdash;the first breeze of wind would snap
the plant from its supports and it would fall to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look now, at the young sweet-peas which we grew
in the pot. They are without tendrils of any kind. This
shows us, I think, that the sweet-pea was at one time a
small plant, like its relative the clover. It grew in open
places and did not have to struggle for light and air.
But, by and by, when strong growing plants took up the
soil, it became forced to produce climbing organs or
become choked out. And, having turned its leaves into
climbing or gripping organs, it made up for the loss of
leaves by producing large stipules and green out-growths
to stem and leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson V.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Draw a leaf of the wild rose and one of the sweet-pea side by side.</dt>
<dt>2. Make a list of all the climbing plants you know, and state how each climbs.</dt>
<dt>3. Look for stipules on the apple, pansy, and bean leaves&mdash;make sketches.</dt>
<dt>4. Those plants of the pea family which have many leaflets have smooth round stems. Those which have few leaflets have &ldquo;winged&rdquo; stems. Can you explain this?</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c6">VI.&mdash;THE GREAT WATER BEETLE.</h2>
<p>During summer the boys paid many visits to the
horse pond. Each time they went there they saw something
to interest them.</p>
<p>Their uncle taught them to keep perfectly still while
looking into the water. They soon came to know that
this was the best way to study pond-life, for, whenever
they moved, the creatures they were watching would
dart out of sight.</p>
<p>One day, while they were both lying on the bank
gazing into the pond, a huge black beetle came up to
the surface of the water. It remained there for a few
moments, with its head hanging downwards and its tail
sticking right out of the water. Then it dived down
out of sight. In a few minutes it came up again, and
this time Frank&rsquo;s net was under it before it could escape.</p>
<p>Just as Frank was putting it into the glass jar, Tom
whispered, &ldquo;Here is another one&mdash;quick, Frank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Frank was too late; for before he could get the
first beetle into the jar, the second one had dived to the
bottom of the pond. The boys waited for a long time,
hoping to see the other beetle again. At last their
patience was rewarded. The beetle came up again to
the surface. As soon as it did so, in went the net, and
out came beetle number two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What big beauties,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I wonder what
they are. Let us hurry home and show them to Uncle
George.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>When they got home, their uncle placed the two
beetles in a glass tank by themselves, so that they
could be more easily observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call them, uncle?&rdquo; asked Frank.
&ldquo;We have never seen such large, handsome beetles
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/illus043.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="379" />
<p class="caption">Dyticus Beetle, male and female.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not?&rdquo; his uncle replied. &ldquo;I am surprised
at that, for this beetle is found in nearly all our ponds
and ditches. It has a long Latin name,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> which means
<b><i>Bordered Diver</i></b>, but it
is commonly known as
the &lsquo;great water beetle.&rsquo;
There are several kinds
of these diving beetles.
This is the largest. Can
you give me an idea of
their size?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Uncle George
handed Frank a small
measuring rule which
he carried in his pocket.</p>
<p>Frank looked at the beetles, and then moved his
thumb nail along the rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About an inch and a half in length,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about right,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;Are these
two beetles exactly alike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are both about the same shape and colour.
One is slightly bigger than the other. They are both
greenish-black above and brown below. There is a
curious broad border of yellow all round the edge of
their bodies,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they are not both exactly alike,&rdquo; said Frank,
&ldquo;I notice that one is smooth on the back, while the
other&rsquo;s back is all grooved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Frank,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;The
one with the grooved wing-cases is the female. The
one with the smooth cases is the male.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/illus044.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fore Leg of Male, showing Sucker Organ.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Notice the long legs
they have for swimming,
and how they seem to
oar themselves through
the water. Notice also
that the male has a large
flat disc upon each of
his fore legs. These are
suckers, by which he
can cling to things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they come up to the surface so often?&rdquo;
Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot live without air. They carry a supply
of air under their wing-cases. They just come up to
renew it from time to time. This is done by thrusting
the end of their bodies out of the water as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think they ought to thrust their heads
out to get air,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems more natural to us, because we breathe
with our mouths,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;These animals
take in air with their tails. A great many pond insects
breathe in this curious way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they feed upon?&rdquo; Frank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fierce, greedy creatures,&rdquo; his uncle replied.
&ldquo;They attack and kill worms, tadpoles, and even small
fishes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Uncle George threw a small worm into the tank.
One of the beetles seized it at once and began to devour
it greedily. Presently the other beetle seized an end of
the worm. The boys watched closely, and saw that the
beetles&rsquo; jaws moved from side to side like a pair of
pincers.</p>
<p>Next morning, when Uncle George and the boys
went in to see the beetles, they found only one in the
tank. The other had escaped during the night. After
a careful search they found it, at the far end of the room,
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how do you think this beetle managed to get
out of the tank and travel all that way?&rdquo; Uncle George
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have crawled up the inside of the tank,
then down the outside. Then it must have fallen off the
window-sill, and crawled right across the floor,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>Uncle George shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have managed to crawl up to
the edge of the tank so long as its legs were wet. But
as its long legs are made for swimming, and not for
crawling with, I can hardly see how it could have crawled
or walked all that distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did it get there, Uncle George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to Frank&rsquo;s question, his uncle took the
dead beetle, and placed it on a piece of paper on the
table. He next moved aside each of the large black
wing-cases with a pin.</p>
<p>Underneath these wing-cases the boys saw a pair
of large wings neatly folded up. Uncle George removed
one of the wing-cases, and unfolded one of the wings.
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Stretched out, it was longer than the beetle&rsquo;s body, and
it seemed to be made up of thin, clear skin, stretched
on a framework of long, thin supports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, these beetles can fly,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/illus046.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="262" />
<p class="caption">Male and Female Beetles, showing Flying Wings.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they can,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;All beetles
can fly. This creature has evidently been flying about
the room all night. These insects are furnished with
wings, so that they may be able to fly to another pool
when food gets scarce, or when their pool dries up.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c7">VII.&mdash;DAISIES.</h2>
<p>While Uncle George and Frank and Tom were
having a game of cricket, Dolly was amusing herself in
another way. She had pulled a bunch of daisies and was
joining them up into a daisy chain.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/illus047.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="659" />
<p class="caption">Common Daisy.</p>
</div>
<p>She finished her daisy chain just as her uncle and the
boys finished their game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take some daisies home,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
He stooped down and dug out a whole daisy plant with
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
his knife, while Dolly gathered a small bunch of the
flowers. When they got home Uncle George placed his
daisy plant in a saucer of water, and told the boys to
bring out their magnifiers and sketch-books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to look at the
daisy plant. Notice its leaves. Each leaf is broad at the
end and narrow where it joins the plant. Notice also that
the leaves all form a round green mat on the ground.
Now, can you tell me what the leaf resembles in
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/illus048.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="378" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Daisy Leaf.</dt>
<dt>2. Primrose Leaf.</dt>
<dt>3. Cowslip Leaf.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is like a spoon,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said his
uncle; &ldquo;and can you see any reason for it being so
shaped?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot? Well, I must tell you. All plants
whose leaves are all at the ground have leaves shaped
something like this. The primrose and cowslip are
good examples. We have seen that plants, like the
pea, climb up so that their leaves and green parts may
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
get as much light and air as possible. And if you look
at any tree, such as the horse-chestnut, ash, elm, or beech,
you will notice that their leaves are spread out so as to
catch as much light as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then drew a circle.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/illus049.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="470" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>1 and 2. Diagram to show Leaf arrangement of Daisy.</dt>
<dt>3. Head of Daisy split.</dt>
<dt>4. Outer Floret.</dt>
<dt>5. Inner Floret.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to try to fill that
circle with leaves so shaped that they will fill it without
covering one another. The best way to do so is to make
them broad at the end. If you make them broad at the
base and narrow at the end, they overlap and rob each
other of light and air. Now you can see why the leaves
of the daisy are so shaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take up a daisy and split it down the centre with
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
your knife. You will notice that the daisy is <i>not</i> a flower,
but a collection of tiny flowers, or florets, all packed
closely together upon a pad or disc, and surrounded
outside by many little green
things like small leaves.
These little leaf-like things
are called <i>bracts</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/illus050.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="403" />
<p class="caption">London Pride, showing Leaf arrangement.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are two distinct
kinds of florets,&rdquo; said Frank,
looking at the split daisy
with his lens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle George,
&ldquo;you will see them better if
you remove one of each with
a pin, and examine them
separately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outer florets are very large and white,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very flat, while the inner ones are yellow
and round. They are very like small crocus flowers.
What is that small two-headed thing that comes out
in the centre of each floret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the part which leads to the seed-vessel.
Can you see the seed-vessel at the bottom of each
floret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it is large and round. On the top
of it and all round the petal part of the floret there are
long silky hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In flowers of this kind, when the seeds are ripe they
are carried away by the wind,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;The petal part withers, but the tuft of hairs remain.
They are to the seed what sails are to a ship. They are
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
much better seen in some other flowers related to the
daisy, such as the thistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now cut open the seed-vessel and see how many
seeds it contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one, I think,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think correctly,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;Each seed-vessel
holds a single seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seed-vessel in the large white floret is small
and flat,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;In fact, the outer florets
seldom produce seeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is the use of them?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said Uncle George. As he spoke he
took up a fresh daisy flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a pretty flower it is, with its
golden centre and its bright white edge tipped with red.
It is like a beautiful star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he pulled off all the large white florets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a dingy, ugly little
flower. Without its white florets it would not be seen
at all. Now perhaps you can tell me what the large
white florets are for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help us to see them at a distance,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that bees and other flying insects may be able
to see them,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insects visit flowers for honey, and, in doing so,
carry the yellow dust, or pollen, from flower to flower.
This pollen, as I told you before, has to do with the
making of seeds: and stronger seeds are produced
if the pollen comes from another flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now compare a white floret with a yellow one,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
and you will notice still another difference between
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round the <i>stigma</i>&mdash;that is the forked tube which
leads to the seed-vessel&mdash;in the yellow florets, there is a
yellow ring of <i>stamens</i>, or pollen-boxes. It is shaped
like a little barrel with its ends knocked out, and the
<i>stigma</i> grows right up through it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the white florets there are no pollen-boxes of
any kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, we see that the inner florets are <i>perfect</i> florets
which produce seeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outer florets have all run to petal. Their
business is to show the way to the plain little florets in
the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another thing about the daisy that I should
like you to notice,&rdquo; Uncle George continued. &ldquo;If you
go out on a dull day, or in the evening, you will find all
the daisy flowers closed up. They only open out in
bright sunshine, when all the insects are flying about.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson VII.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Daises are called &ldquo;composite&rdquo; flowers. Can you tell why? Cut a large &ldquo;ox-eye daisy&rdquo; or corn marigold through the centre and examine the florets carefully.</dt>
<dt>2. Using a lens, draw separately, an inside and an outside floret. Make your drawings large, and name the various parts of each floret.</dt>
<dt>3. Take two ox-eye daisies. Pull off all the white florets of one of them. Then compare them. Pin both flowers up on the wall. Go back about thirty paces and note which flower is best seen.</dt>
<dt>4. The daisy leaves form a little rosette on the ground. Make a collection of wild plants which have similar leaves. Draw a single leaf of each, and compare with those of the daisy.</dt></dl>

<p class="caption">Nest of Chaffinch.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII.&mdash;CHAFFINCH AND SONG-THRUSH.</h2>
<p>It was Frank who found the chaffinch&rsquo;s nest in the
wood. It was built in the fork of a small tree, about
eight feet from the ground.</p>
<p>Although not surrounded either by branches or leaves,
it was completely hidden, for the cunning little birds had
matched the outside of the nest exactly with the bark
of the tree.</p>
<p>Uncle George got an old chaffinch&rsquo;s nest from the
gardener, and showed the boys how it was constructed.
Horse-hair, feathers, and moss were neatly woven
together to form the nest. The inside was lined with
finer hairs and feathers. The outside was covered with
pieces of bark, lichen, and faded moss. These were
stuck on with silken threads stolen from spider&rsquo;s webs.
The whole thing looked at a distance more like a part
of the tree than a bird&rsquo;s nest.</p>

<p class="caption">THE THRUSH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The next time the boys went to see the nest they
found four tiny eggs in it. They were bluish-green in
colour, and splashed with red and brown marks.</p>
<p>It was while paying a third visit to the chaffinch&rsquo;s
nest that Uncle George found the nest of the song-thrush.</p>
<p>High up on a tall tree the cock thrush was pouring
out his song, and filling the woods with melody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see him, boys?&rdquo; Uncle George asked, and
he handed Frank a pair of field-glasses which he used
for watching the birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I can see him quite plainly.
He is a brown bird, with a white and yellow breast, all
dotted over with small dark spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not such a beautiful bird as the chaffinch,&rdquo;
said Uncle George, &ldquo;but he is a much finer singer.
Our prettiest birds are by no means our best songsters.
The lark, thrush, linnet, and nightingale are all plain
birds to look at, but they are by far our sweetest singers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us what you see through the glasses, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see him nicely,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He holds his
head high in the air, as if he were singing to the sky.
His bill is wide open, and the feathers of his throat are
moving rapidly as he sings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;that his nest must
be near. Let us look for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Uncle George moved, a brown bird flew out
of a low bush close at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;I thought we should
find it. We have disturbed the hen bird. She has been
sitting on her eggs all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved the branches of the bush gently aside,
and the boys saw a large nest made of dried grass. It
was not very high up, and the boys, by standing on an
old tree stump, could look down into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what pretty eggs,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;There are four
of them, Uncle George. They are light blue in colour,
and sprinkled with black spots.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/illus059.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="189" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>Egg of Song-Thrush.</dt>
<dt>Egg of Chaffinch.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The nest is quite smooth and hard inside. What
is that queer brown stuff all over the inside of the nest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is clay, Tom. When the thrushes have built
their nest, they line the inside of it with clay. This clay
is soft at first, but it soon dries and turns quite hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, come, let us go, boys. The cock thrush has
stopped his singing. He and his little wife are flying
about in great alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came to the chaffinch&rsquo;s neat little nest in
the fork of the tree, they got a great surprise. The four
little mottled eggs were gone. In their place were four
tiny naked creatures, with little tufts of dark coloured
down upon their heads and necks. They had very large
mouths, and their eyes were closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what funny little things,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, the baby chaffinches stretched
out their slender little necks, opened their wide, gaping
mouths, and cried for food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pink, Pink, Pink!</i>&rdquo; came from a neighbouring tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, Frank!&rdquo; Uncle George whispered.
&ldquo;Let us go back from the nest, and we will perhaps
see the old birds feeding them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With another &ldquo;<i>Pink, Pink, Pink</i>,&rdquo; the cock chaffinch
flew down and stood on the edge of the nest. He had
something in his bill. This he dropped into one of the
gaping little mouths, and flew away.</p>
<p>Next came the hen bird with something in her bill.
She fed another of the hungry little birds, and flew away
also.</p>
<p>The boys were greatly interested. They wanted to
stay the whole afternoon and watch the chaffinches feeding
their young, but their uncle would not allow this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my dear boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must not annoy
our little feathered friends too much, or they may forsake
their beautiful nest and their helpless young ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will come back in a fortnight and see the young
birds. You will not know them then, for they will be
fully fledged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;fully fledged,&rsquo; Uncle George?&rdquo;
Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means covered all over with feathers, does it not?&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>
<p>Their uncle nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these little birds not cold without feathers?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; his uncle answered. &ldquo;During the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
day they cuddle up together in their cosy nest. At night
the mother bird folds her wings over the nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the cock bird go at night?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sleeps on a branch quite near the nest,&rdquo; his
uncle answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just two more questions to ask, Uncle
George,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;What do the chaffinches feed
their young ones on? and what becomes of the young
birds after they are fledged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They feed their young chiefly on small worms, flies,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
grubs, beetles, and other insects. When the young
chaffinches are fledged, their parents lead them from
the nest. They teach them to fly, and show them where
to find their food. They never lose sight of them until
they are quite grown up and able to take care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c9">IX.&mdash;PLANTS THAT ARM THEMSELVES.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Some time ago,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;I promised to
tell you something about how plants arm themselves.
And here, in this hedgerow, we have some good
examples of armed plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the stinging nettle,&rdquo; said Tom, pointing
to a large patch at the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stinging nettle is certainly well protected,&rdquo;
said his uncle. &ldquo;You have only to touch any part of
it lightly with your hand to find that out. Every part
of the plant is covered with small needle-shaped hairs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
These hairs are hollow and contain a poisonous juice.
At the base of each hair there is a bag filled with this
juice, while the tip of each is sharp and very brittle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your hand touches a nettle&mdash;unless you grasp
it tightly&mdash;the sharp hair pierces the skin. It&rsquo;s brittle
point breaks off and the poisonous juice is poured
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is the nettle covered with these horrid stings?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save it from being eaten up, of course. The
nettle is a tender and juicy plant, and, if it were not for
its stings it would soon disappear altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, here is another armed plant, the blackberry
or bramble. The stem and also the backs of the leaves
are covered with large curved prickles. These prickles
not only protect the plant from grazing animals, but
they help it to climb and scramble up walls and
hedges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you try to pull a bramble branch down out of the
hawthorn hedge, you will find it rather difficult, for its
large prickles are all turned one way. They are really
sharp hooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a wild rose bush. It is also covered with
large hooked prickles,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom, and, like the bramble, it threads its way
among stronger and taller plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wild gooseberry growing close beside it is
also armed with prickles. But the prickles of the
gooseberry are for protecting its tender leaves. It is
not a climbing plant like the rose and bramble. The
raspberry also is covered with many sharp little prickles.
There is a clump of these plants growing at the other
side of the road. Let us cut off a small branch of each
of these plants and take them home.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most prickly plant of all,&rdquo; said Frank, as
he halted before a huge thistle. &ldquo;You can scarcely
touch it without getting severely pricked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thistle is well armed,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;There are sharp prickles on its leaves, on its stem,
and on its flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked down the road they came upon a
mass of whin bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;we have a plant which
has turned its leaves into sharp spines.&rdquo; He bent down
and pulled up a tiny plant which was growing under the
larger gorse bushes. &ldquo;Look at this little plant, boys.
This is a young whin plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not a bit like the
whin, Uncle George,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Its leaves are soft and flat.
They are more like clover leaves.
There are no spines or prickles
on this little plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, Tom; but still
it is a young whin plant.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/illus066.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="571" />
<p class="caption">Young Whins.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are a great many
of these young whins growing
under the older bushes. Let us
take a few of them home. If we grow one of them
in a pot, and supply it with plenty of water, we will
find that it will <i>never</i> produce sharp prickles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very wonderful,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;and it teaches us something
of the whin&rsquo;s history. Like the nettle, the whin is
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
a juicy plant, and, if it were not for its prickles, would
be eaten by cows, sheep, and horses. In fact, some
farmers give whins to their horses. Of course the
whins are passed through a mill first. The mill crushes
the whins and destroys the prickles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shows us that many, many years ago the whin
was a soft-leaved plant like the clover. It grew in moist
soil. But by and by other plants invaded the land.
These plants grew more quickly than the whin, and
choked it out of the rich moist soil. Forced to grow
upon bare hill-sides and commons, the soft-leaved
juicy whin would be destroyed by grazing animals if it
did not arm itself with sharp spines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the blackthorn or sloe. It bears many hard,
sharp-pointed spines. Yet, if we grow a sloe plant in
the garden, we find that its sharp spines gradually
disappear. They become branches bearing leaves and
flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But plants have other ways of protecting themselves
against animals. Look through the hedge into the
meadow and you will notice that while the grass has been
eaten bare, there are other plants which have been left to
grow up untouched. Buttercups grow up all over the
field, and tall ragwort plants. How is it that the cows
do not eat these plants? They are not armed with spines
or prickles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They protect themselves in another way. They
contain bitter or poisonous juices. No cow will eat a
buttercup. If it did so it would be ill and uncomfortable
for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to notice, boys, that&mdash;with the exception
of those plants, like the bramble and wild rose, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
use their prickles for climbing as well as for protection&mdash;all
our armed plants grow in exposed places. The thistle
and whin are good examples of this.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson IX.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Take in twigs of hawthorn, barberry, holly, bramble, and gooseberry. Examine, and sketch them so as to show their protective parts.</dt>
<dt>2. Grow a small whin bush in a pot and water it daily. Note that the <i>new growth</i> it makes is tender, and that <i>no spines</i> are produced.</dt>

<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c10">X.&mdash;THE HORSE POND AGAIN.</h2>
<p>Frank and Tom returned from the horse pond one
day with their jars filled with curious creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We took the water beetle back to the pond, Uncle
George,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and I almost felt sorry to let
such a cruel and greedy monster loose among the other creatures
in the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have here creatures even more cruel and greedy
than the diving beetle,&rdquo; said his uncle, looking into the
glass jars which the boys had brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the larva of the diving beetle, and a fiercer
or greedier creature is not to be found in the whole
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George refilled the three large tanks. He
poured the contents of one of the jars into one of the
tanks. It contained, besides the larv&aelig; he spoke of, a
number of tadpoles, some small stickle-backs, and a
great many water snails or whelks.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there were one or two curious
insects, with a pair of very long legs. They came to
the surface every now and then, and moved their long
limbs like oars. Whenever the tank was touched, they
would suddenly dive to the bottom. Here they would
remain for a short time, then, returning to the surface,
would &ldquo;oar&rdquo; themselves along as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these queer things, Uncle George?&rdquo; Tom
asked. &ldquo;They look exactly like little boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are beetles,&rdquo; Uncle George replied, &ldquo;and they
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
do resemble little row-boats&mdash;so much so that they are
called &lsquo;water boatmen.&rsquo; This beetle&rsquo;s body is shaped
like a boat, and he lies on his back and moves his very
long hind legs exactly
like oars. He has a
large, sharp beak, which
you can see if you look
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Uncle George
was speaking, a small fly
alighted on the surface
of the water. It was
immediately seized by a
water boatman, who
dived with it to the
bottom of the tank.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/illus070.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="600" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Water Boatman.</dt>
<dt>2. Water Whelk.</dt>
<dt>3. Water Hog Louse.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is how the
creature feeds,&rdquo; said
Uncle George. &ldquo;When
an unlucky fly comes
near, he seizes it with
his two fore pairs of
short legs, drives his
cruel beak deep into its
body, and dives with it
to the bottom of the pool. When he has drowned
his victim, he devours it at leisure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us look at the creature I first spoke of&mdash;the
larva of the diving beetle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were several in the tank. Uncle George lifted
one out with a small gauze net. He placed it in a
saucer of water and asked the boys to sketch it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;It has six legs,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Its head is large
and flat, and there are two things like horns sticking
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the creature&rsquo;s jaws,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>Uncle George touched the creature&rsquo;s head with the
point of his pencil. Instantly the long, curved fangs
moved apart, and the creature sprang at the pencil and
closed its fangs upon the wood.</p>

<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Larva of Diving Beetle.</dt>
<dt>2, 3. Head, showing how Fangs work.</dt>
<dt>4. Larva seizing Tadpole.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a fierce creature,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied his uncle. &ldquo;We must remove the
others from the tank, or there will be nothing left alive
in it. See, one of them has caught a tadpole already.&rdquo;
And, sure enough, the creature had sunk his cruel
pincers deep into the body of a tadpole. He shook the
tadpole as a dog would shake a rat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those huge fangs are hollow,&rdquo; Uncle George continued.
&ldquo;With them he sucks every drop of blood from
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
his victim&rsquo;s body. In this way he devours tadpoles,
whelks, little fishes, and even his own weaker brethren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to put these larv&aelig; in a tank by
themselves, and feed them upon pieces of fresh raw
meat, to keep them from devouring one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, I am going to describe this larva. Look
closely, and see if I am right. You can correct your
drawings as we go along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His body, which is nearly two inches long, is narrow
at each end and broad at the middle. It is divided into
twelve segments, and to each of the first three of these
segments a pair of legs are attached. His large, flat
head is almost heart-shaped. At its broad end are a
pair of large, beady eyes, three pairs of organs which
look like feelers, and the two large, curved fangs with
which he seizes his prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice how beautifully the legs are adapted for
swimming. They are edged with long, stiff hairs, which
stand out flat with every down stroke, but fold in when
the legs move upwards. That is how the creature is
such a graceful swimmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last three segments of his body are thickly
covered with long hairs. His tail is divided into two
long plumes. You can see what these are for, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Like the parent beetle, the
larva comes often to the surface and hangs downwards
with his tail exposed to the air. So these plumes must
be his breathing organs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do these long, slender creatures actually become
broad, stout beetles like the one we returned to the pond
to-day?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom, they do. Just as your green caterpillar
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
became a beautiful white butterfly. These larv&aelig; hatched
out of eggs which were laid by the female beetle in the
stem of some water weed. She first cuts a slit in the
water weed, and then places an egg in the slit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the larv&aelig; are full grown, they crawl out of the
pond and bury themselves in ground. Here they pass
the winter in the pupa stage. They come out in spring,
fully-formed beetles, and pass the remainder of their
lives in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these curious creatures that crawl among
the water weeds?&rdquo; Frank asked. &ldquo;They are very like
the &lsquo;slaters&rsquo; which we find among old wood-work in
the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That creature is the &lsquo;water hog.&rsquo; Its proper name
is <i>Asellus</i>, and it is very closely related to the garden
&lsquo;slater&rsquo; or wood-louse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These water hogs, like the whelks, are very useful
in an aquarium. They eat up all waste matter, and so
help greatly to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the by, I want you to watch the whelks from
day to day. They usually lay their eggs in a clear, broad
band on the inside of the glass tank; and with our lenses
we can watch the changes in these eggs nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson X.</h3>

<h2 id="c11">XI.&mdash;WASPS.</h2>
<p>The wasp&rsquo;s nest was found at the edge of the wood,
hanging from the branch of a small tree. It was greyish
white in colour, shaped like a pear, and about the size
of a hen&rsquo;s egg.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">

</div>
<p>Uncle George removed it from the branch and carried
it home carefully, for it was very light and very fragile.
He took a pair of scissors and cut through the thin walls
so as to remove nearly half of the coverings. When he
had finished cutting, two thin, papery shells fell upon the
table, one a size smaller than the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine the stuff the wasp&rsquo;s nest is made of, and
tell me what it is most like, boys,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more like paper than anything else,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> paper,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did the wasps find this paper?&rdquo; Frank
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &lsquo;<i>wasps</i>,&rsquo; Frank, but <i>wasp</i>,&rdquo; his uncle answered,
&ldquo;for this nest was all built by <i>one</i> wasp. The insect did
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
not find the paper. She made it. It was the wasp who
first taught man to make paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The queen wasp awakens from her winter sleep in
spring, and at once sets about making her nest. She
gathers tiny fragments of wood and bark, chews them
up, and mixes them with a fluid from her mouth. This,
when it hardens, is paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First she makes a stiff rod, or pillar, of paper. This
hangs down from the branch and forms the centre of the
nest. Round this are built the walls of her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe, boys, that there are two distinct walls of
paper, one inside the other; and there is a wide air
space between them all the way round. The entrance to
the nest is at the bottom. Round the centre pillar there is
a little thing shaped like an opened umbrella. If you look
underneath this, you will see something curious, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;it is divided into six cells, and
in each cell there is a small, stout maggot or grub. I
can see them moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the young wasps,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;Like your butterflies and caddis flies, the wasp passes
through egg, larva (or caterpillar), and pupa stage before
it becomes a perfect insect. These are in the larva stage
but, unlike your caterpillars, they have no legs, and they
cannot feed themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the mother wasp must have laid an egg in
each cell,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and these grubs hatched out of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;You see what a
clever and industrious creature a wasp is. To build this
beautiful nest all alone and unaided, and to rear and feed
her helpless grubs, is a task indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are the wasp grubs fed on?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;they are fed on animal
food, and this keeps the queen wasp hunting insects all
day long. As they grow older, they are fed upon honey.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wasps which come from these first eggs are
&lsquo;worker&rsquo; wasps. As soon as they are hatched out,
they begin to enlarge the nest. This they do by removing
the inside wall and building a new and larger outer wall.
This is done from time to time, until at last the nest
becomes as big as an ordinary-sized turnip. While this
is going on, more and more cells are being built inside,
until at last five or six large combs of cells fill the inside
of the nest. The queen wasp lays an egg in each cell
as it is formed; and the worker wasps gather food and
nurse the young grubs until they become perfect wasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by some young queens, or female wasps, are
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
hatched out. These lay eggs, and soon the population
the paper nest numbers many thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is why the gardener kills every wasp he
sees in spring time,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every wasp we see in spring,&rdquo; said Uncle George,
&ldquo;is a queen wasp. If allowed to live, each queen would
become the founder
of a nest and the
mother of thousands
of wasps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why destroy
the wasps?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because wasps
are very destructive
and dangerous insects,&rdquo;
said Uncle
George. &ldquo;They destroy
our best fruit,
and their sting is
poisonous, sometimes
causing
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the summer
the boys found several wasp&rsquo;s nests. One was
built under-ground at the roadside. Another was built
inside a wren&rsquo;s nest. The queen wasp who built it had
driven the wrens out. A third nest hung from the
branch of a gooseberry bush in the garden.</p>

<p>The latter was watched by Uncle George and the

wasps became too numerous. One day they chased
Tom and Frank out of the garden and stung them
badly. Then Uncle George removed the nest. Putting
on his bee-veil and gloves, he cut off the branch from
which the nest hung. He put nest and branch inside a
large box; and, having placed a saucer containing
burning sulphur inside the box, he closed the lid.</p>

see queens, workers, and male wasps, eggs, larv&aelig;, and
pup&aelig;, and to make drawings of each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of the wasps in winter?&rdquo; Frank
asked his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come to a sad end, Frank,&rdquo; said Uncle George.
&ldquo;They do not store food like the hive bee, and so, when
the cold weather comes, they starve to death.</p>

<p>Uncle George and the boys were having a stroll along
a lane where briar and hawthorn and all sorts of wild
flowers grew. Although it was an October day the sun
was shining brightly, and all along the wayside the golden
flowers of the dandelion opened wide to the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that the dandelion was an early summer
flower,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said his uncle; &ldquo;but this year the autumn
has been so warm that our dandelions are flowering a
second time. This often happens with many of our wild
flowers during an extra mild season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to dig up one of these dandelion plants,
take it home and grow it in a pot. It is a most interesting
plant to observe, especially the growth and ripening of its
seeds. I see here dandelion flowers in almost every stage
of their growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look you will find among the wide open
flower-heads many others which are closed. Let us split
a few of these down the centre, and we will find that they
are not all alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is one with a bright yellow tip. This one has
not yet opened. If you use your lens you will notice that,
like the daisy, this is not a single flower, but is made up of
a great many small yellow florets. These florets stand
upon a flat round disc, and they are surrounded by two
rings of green things called bracts. One set of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
bracts stands up straight. These protect the florets.
They open and close the flower. The down pointing
bracts protect the flower from ants and crawling
insects.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Frank, look at the split flower and tell me what
you see with your glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;The florets are all of one kind,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;They
are all strap shaped, and there are a great many of them.
The younger florets are in the middle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to pull the florets out and count them
you would find about three hundred of them in a single
flower-head,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig43">

<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Dandelion Flower-head not yet opened.</dt>
<dt>2. Single Floret of same.</dt>
<dt>3, 4, 5. Flower-head closed for Seed ripening.</dt>
<dt>6. Second time of opening.</dt></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, take one single floret and examine it, please.
It is very like the outer (white) florets of the daisy. But
it is more complete. There is a large seed-vessel at the
bottom. Just above this there are a great number of long
silky hairs. You will see what these are for by and by.
The lower part of the floret is tubular, but it opens up
into a long yellow strap-shaped petal. There are really
five petals all joined together here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;at the top of the floret I can
see five distinct teeth, and five ridges run down from
them. I also see the barrel-shaped ring of stamens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us gather some more of the closed flowers,&rdquo; said
Uncle George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two other closed flowers. One of them has
a yellow tip, withered and faded almost to brown. The
other has a white woolly tip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have these not opened yet?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! they have opened and closed up again. The
dandelion opens out to the sun so that flying insects may
visit it and carry pollen from flower to flower. When it
has received, in this way, enough pollen to enable its
seeds to form, it closes up completely and remains
closed until its seeds are ripened. During this time the
short stalk between the seed-vessel and petal part grows
long. If you look again at a single floret you will see
that this short stout stack bears the long straight hairs
I spoke of. The flower-head closes so tightly that
the yellow strap-shaped petal parts of the florets are
squeezed together into a bunch. They soon wither.
Meantime all the hair-tipped seed-stalks are growing
longer and longer. At last they push the bunch of
withered petals right out of the flower and it falls off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George then gathered a few more closed heads,
and, by cutting them open, showed the boys all the stages
in the growth of the seeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the dandelion flower-head opens for the last
time, instead of a flat golden mass of florets, this is what
appears.&rdquo; As he spoke, Uncle George pointed to a
dandelion head which was one huge fluffy ball of stalked
seeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Frank held it up and blew his breath upon it.
Immediately all the seeds went sailing through the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the flower-head keep closed when the
seeds are ripening?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Uncle George, &ldquo;not only has the
seed to ripen, but a plumed stalk has to be formed by
means of which the seed is carried away from the
parent plant. These plumes have to be perfectly
dry or they would be of no use as sails to the seed.
Notice that it is only on dry days that these &lsquo;clocks&rsquo;
of the dandelion appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Uncle George,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;are these seeds
actually fitted with feathery tops so that they may be
carried far away from the parent plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my boy. You would not have them all
trying to grow in the place where the parent plant grows,
would you? There would be no room for three hundred
seeds to grow there. Besides that, the parent plant
has already exhausted the soil. It is necessary that they
should seek pastures new, and therefore the seeds of most
plants are furnished with some means of travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are all seeds carried by the wind?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no,&rdquo; Uncle George replied, &ldquo;plants have
many ways of scattering their seeds. Some plants, by
suddenly bursting their seed-vessels, shoot their seeds far
out; some seeds are furnished with little hooks which grip
on to the fur of passing animals; some are carried by
birds; but by far the greater number are scattered by
the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall learn more about these at some future
time. Meantime we will grow a dandelion plant at
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
home, and watch the opening and closing of its flowers,
and the wonderful way in which its travelling seeds are
produced.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson XII.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Gather dandelion flowers at different stages of growth. Draw, on a large scale, a single floret from each,</dt>
<dt>2. Draw a leaf of the dandelion. Compare it with a primrose leaf. See if you can make out, from the shape of the leaf, why the plant is called &ldquo;dandelion&rdquo; (<i>dent de lion</i> = &ldquo;lion&rsquo;s tooth&rdquo;).</dt>
<dt>3. Take in a dandelion plant bearing young flowers. Keep the root in well-watered soil, or in water only, and watch the growth of its flowers.</dt>
<dt>4. Make a list of all the wind-carried seeds you know, and give a drawing or short description of each.</dt></dl>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c13">XIII.&mdash;TROUT.</h2>
<p>One day in November the postman brought Uncle
George a small wooden box. There were holes bored
in the sides and top of it. The box, when opened,
seemed to be filled with damp moss; but when some
of this moss was removed there was found in the middle
of the box a piece of folded muslin.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/illus092.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="273" />
<dl class="undent"><dt>Hatching Bottle.</dt>
<dd>A. Supply pipe.</dd>
<dd>B. Exhaust pipe.</dd>
<dd>C. Trout Eggs.</dd>
<dt>Rearing Box.</dt>
<dd>C. Perforated zinc tray to fit box.</dd></dl>
</div>
<p>Uncle George laid the muslin on the table, and opened
it out. It contained a number of tiny pink balls, much
smaller than peas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the trout eggs you promised to get for
us, are they not?&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said Uncle George, &ldquo;and we must put
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
them into running water at once. I have a bottle here
ready for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George filled a wide-mouthed bottle with water
from the tap and placed the eggs in it. He then corked
it with a cork in which he had bored two holes.</p>
<p>Into each of the holes he had fitted a tube. One
tube was long enough to reach almost to the bottom of
the bottle. The other was bent over the outside of the
bottle.</p>
<p>The straight tube was connected with the water tap
by a piece of indiarubber tubing. He then turned the
tap on gently, so that the water went in by the straight
tube and came dripping out by the bent tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trout require a constant supply of fresh water,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Their eggs are usually laid in shallow
streams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, I want you to watch these eggs and
note down any changes you see in them. You can
remove the bottle from the tap at any time, but you
must not keep it more than fifteen minutes at a time,
or your trout will not hatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of a week the boys noticed two black
dots and a coiled white line in each egg.</p>
<p>In two weeks more some curious-looking creatures
were seen wriggling about among the eggs. As there
were some empty egg-skins to be seen, they guessed
that these lively creatures must be young trout.</p>
<p>They were not a bit like fish. Each seemed to be
made up of a long white streak, which looked like the
&ldquo;backbone&rdquo; of a fish, a big, clumsy yellow bag with
red veins running through it, and two large black spots
that looked like eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>In a few days all the eggs hatched out, and in place
of the little pink eggs there was a crowd of these
wriggling creatures and a number of empty egg-skins.
The boys were puzzled, and Uncle George had to be
consulted.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig46">
<img src="images/illus094.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="414" />
<p class="caption">Six Stages in Development of Trout.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think these were trout eggs,&rdquo; said Frank.
&ldquo;The creatures that came out of them are not a bit like
fishes. They swim on their sides and have a huge
yellow bag attached to their bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> young trout, I can assure you, Frank,&rdquo;
said his uncle laughing. &ldquo;If you remember, your
tadpoles were not a bit like frogs when they hatched
out of the egg. These huge bags you talk of are called
&lsquo;yolks.&rsquo; Each trout when hatched is furnished with a
huge yolk or food supply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;The tadpole, when hatched, has also got a yolk
upon which he lives without eating for four or five days.
Our trout will require no food for six weeks. During
that time the yolk will become smaller and smaller, and
at last disappear entirely. While the yolk is shrinking,
you will notice that the creature gradually assumes the
form of a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George emptied the bottle containing the young
trout into a wooden box which he had made. This box
was fifteen inches long, four inches broad, and four
inches deep. The inside of it he had charred with a
red-hot iron after it was put together. It was placed
under the tap, and the water dripped into it all day and
all night.</p>
<p>Frank made a small gauze net about the size of a
dessert-spoon, and with this they lifted troutlets out of
the box whenever they wanted to examine them.</p>
<p>As their uncle had said, the creatures changed from
day to day. By placing a single trout in a white saucer,
the boys could note these changes; but they were such
lively little creatures that making good sketches of them
was somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>First the big black dots became more like eyes. Then
delicate fins and tail appeared, and mouths which opened
and shut. At the top of the yolk-sac, just under the
head, the boys could see a little red thing like a heart
beating constantly. As the yolk-sac grew smaller, the
little fish&rsquo;s body grew more shapely, and tiny brown
spots appeared all over it.</p>
<p>At last, at the end of six weeks, the yolk was completely
gone, and the young trout were now beautiful
little fish, shaped and coloured exactly like big trout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Then Uncle George began to feed them. They were
fed four times a day on the yolk of an egg which had
been boiled for half an hour. A very small quantity of
this hard yolk was squeezed through a piece of gauze
into the water, and the little fishes dashed at it and
gobbled it up greedily.</p>
<p>They were so rapid in their movements, swimming
about and leaping out of the water, that the boys were
never tired of watching them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the brown spots on a trout for?&rdquo; Frank
asked his uncle one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trout is protected by his colour,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;Each trout is coloured like the bed of the
stream he lives in, and the spots resemble grains of sand
and tiny pebbles. The trout can change his colour, like
the frog, as I will show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George took two trout out of the box and
placed them in a glass dish. He placed the dish in a
white saucer, and so arranged it that water was kept
flowing into and out of it.</p>
<p>Next day he took two more trout out of the box and
placed them in the glass dish. It was then seen that
the first two trout had grown quite light in colour. They
were much paler than those taken out of the box, the
inside of which was charred and black.</p>
<p>One day Uncle George found two of the trout dead
in the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we cannot keep
them confined any longer. Get a large pail full of water,
and we will carry them to the brook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must come here and fish next year, Frank,&rdquo;
said Tom, after the trout were transferred to the brook.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
&ldquo;How long will it be before they become big trout,
Uncle George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are now about an inch long,&rdquo; said Uncle
George. &ldquo;In a year they will be four inches long. In
about three years, if they are not devoured by larger
trout, they will weigh about a pound apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is a shame to kill such pretty little
creatures,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you, Frank,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<h3>Exercises on Lesson XIII.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Compare a newly-hatched trout with a seed (bean). How do they resemble, and how do they differ from one another?</dt>
<dt>2. The trout is protected by its colour markings. Make a list of any other animals you know that are &ldquo;colour protected.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>3. If you put a fish (trout) into water which has been boiled and allowed to cool, it dies. What are your reasons for this?</dt>
<dt>4. Make notes, with sketches, of the development of a young trout from the time it is hatched until it requires food.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c14">XIV.&mdash;SILKWORMS.</h2>
<p>The silkworm eggs came in a very small box. They
were sent by a friend of Uncle George&rsquo;s who lived in
the south of England. The eggs were stuck to pieces
of paper in scattered groups. Some pieces of paper had
only one or two eggs on them, others had as many as
forty. They were small, round things, flattened on the
top, and coloured light green. They reminded the boys
of small mustard seeds, but they were not so round.</p>
<p>In answer to Frank&rsquo;s question as to why the eggs
were laid in irregular groups, Uncle George answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the silk-moth emerges from her pupa case,
she lays her eggs anywhere on the floor of her cage.
As the eggs are coated with a gluey material when newly
laid, they stick firmly to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people who rear silkworms always have a
sheet of clean paper covering the floor of the cage before
egg-laying commences. After the eggs are laid, they are
found adhering to this sheet of paper. The paper is
taken out of the larva cage, and those parts containing
eggs are cut out with scissors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many eggs are laid by one moth,&rdquo; Frank
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From four to five hundred,&rdquo; his uncle replied. &ldquo;Let
us get our larva cage cleaned out, and we will put these
eggs in the lower part of it and await their hatching.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the <i>lower</i> part,&rdquo; Frank asked, as he set
about cleaning the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because its floor is a drawer which can be pulled
out. If you put them in the upper part, you must lay a
sheet of paper on the floor first, for your silkworms
must not be handled on any account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long do we have to wait for these eggs
to hatch?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/illus099.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="265" />
<p class="caption">Larva Case.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That depends altogether upon the amount of warmth
they receive, Tom. They will remain unhatched ever
so long if kept in a cool place; but whenever they are
placed where they can get the necessary amount of
warmth, they begin to hatch. Let us put them in the
front window, where they can get most sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About a week after the larva cage was placed in the
window, Frank reported to his uncle that some of the
eggs had turned white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your lens and examine carefully those eggs
which have lost their colour,&rdquo; said Uncle George.</p>
<p>Lifting out one of the small pieces of paper with eggs
on it, Frank examined it with the glass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these colourless eggs are just empty
shells, and there are two small creatures crawling along
the edge of the paper. How small they are! They are
no longer than the breadth of a pin-head. They are
almost black in colour, covered all over with hair, and
have very large heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, these are newly-hatched silkworms,&rdquo; said
Uncle George, &ldquo;and they are already looking for food.
Run out to the garden and bring in some fresh lettuce
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle George carefully dried the lettuce leaves before
putting them into the cage. In two days all the eggs
were hatched, and in their place were as many black,
hairy, crawling little creatures with clumsy heads.
Although they did not seem to eat much, they grew
very rapidly. When three days old, they were fully twice
as big as when hatched.</p>
<p>In five days the silkworms seemed to have increased
in number as well as in size. In fact, there
seemed to be twice as many grubs as there were of
eggs.</p>
<p>Then Uncle George explained that half of these were
not grubs, but simply empty skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silkworm, in order to grow, must cast its skin,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It does this four times during its lifetime.
Look out for another <i>moult</i>, or skin-casting, in four days&rsquo;
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four days later the grubs cast their skins again, just
as Uncle George had said. They were now about half
an inch in length, and much lighter in colour.</p>
<p>In six further days they moulted a third time. Instead
of dingy, hairy grubs, they were now hairless caterpillars,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
yellowish-white in colour, and with round black heads.
Their fourth and last moult took place in another week.
By this time they were over an inch in length. They
now began to eat the lettuce leaves ravenously, and
grew very fast. For ten days they ate much and grew
rapidly. Then they seemed to get tired of feeding, and
began to crawl lazily up the sides of their cage.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">

<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Eggs.</dt>
<dt>2. Larva.</dt>
<dt>3. Silk Cocoon.</dt>
<dt>4. Chrysalis.</dt></dl></div>
<p>&ldquo;They are full grown now, boys,&rdquo; said Uncle
George, &ldquo;and will soon begin to spin their silken
cocoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are now about three inches long, and very
different from the tiny hairy grubs which came out of
the eggs over a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been comparing drawings of them with
drawings we made of the caterpillar of the white cabbage
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
butterfly,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and we find that they are very
much alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said Uncle George. &ldquo;They are,
indeed, very much alike. The body is made up of
thirteen segments, and they have the same number of
legs. They differ from the cabbage caterpillar, however,
in size and colour. Notice the little horn which sticks
up out of the twelfth segment. Your cabbage caterpillar
did not have that. If you look closely you will
notice a long silk thread issuing from the head of one
of these silk-spinning caterpillars. This one has just
begun to make his cocoon; and, in order to prevent
his threads becoming entangled with those of the other
caterpillars, I will place this small paper cone over
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day Uncle George covered several of the caterpillars
with paper cones. On the roof of the cage the
boys saw one caterpillar surrounded with a flimsy web
of silk of a golden-yellow colour. As they watched
the creature turning its head round and round inside
the silky veil, their uncle told them that the creature
was spinning silk at the rate of about a foot per
minute.</p>
<p>In three days each caterpillar had surrounded itself
with a dense silken cocoon as large as a walnut. Then
Uncle George took one of the cocoons, and, cutting it
open, showed the boys the brown, shining chrysalis inside.
He took another cocoon, and, having dipped it into warm
water, began to wind the silken thread on to a piece of
card.</p>
<p>Both Frank and Tom were amazed at the length of
this silken thread. They were more surprised when they
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
were told that each caterpillar produces a silk thread
more than half a mile long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, please, Uncle George,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;why
the creature spins all this silk, and how it makes it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are asking a difficult question,&rdquo; said his uncle,
&ldquo;but I will tell you something about it.</p>

<dl class="undent"><dt>S. Silk Fibres.</dt>
<dt>W. Wool.</dt>
<dt>C. Cotton.</dt>
<dd>(All highly magnified.)</dd></dl>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The creature spins this cocoon to protect its
chrysalis, of course. The silk is produced in two long,
coiled tubes, which occupy nearly the whole length of
the creature&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silk, before it issues from the caterpillar&rsquo;s body, is
a fluid. Whenever it comes out into the air, it becomes
horny. Two strands are produced at once&mdash;one from
each of the long coiled tubes. Before they leave the
caterpillar&rsquo;s body they are pressed together to form one
flat, ribbon-like thread. Silk is one of the strongest
fibres in the world. It is nearly as strong as steel, and
much stronger than many of our metals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a fortnight your silken cocoons will produce
white, fluffy moths. &lsquo;Then you can supply your friends
with hundreds of &lsquo;silkworm&rsquo; eggs, and still have enough
over to stock your larva cage.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Exercises on Lesson XIV.</h3>
<dl class="ex"><dt>1. Are &ldquo;silkworms&rdquo; really worms? What creatures do they most resemble?</dt>
<dt>2. Many of our common caterpillars spin silk of a kind. Take in &ldquo;woolly bear&rdquo; caterpillars. Feed them on the plants you find them on. Compare the cocoons they make with those of the &ldquo;silkworm.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>3. Compare egg, larva, pupa, and perfect insect of the &ldquo;silkworm&rdquo; with that of the white cabbage butterfly. Does the caterpillar of the latter spin any silk?</dt>
<dt>4. Make a list of all the spinning insects you know, and try to explain the use of the &ldquo;silk&rdquo; thread in each case.</dt></dl>

<h2 id="c15">APPENDIX.
<br />HINTS TO TEACHERS.</h2>
<p><b>STRUCTURE OF STEMS.</b>&mdash;One- and two-year-old twigs of horse-chestnut,
elm, and willow should be cut into half-inch lengths and
distributed among the class. If cut straight across with a sharp pen-knife,
the different layers can be seen with the naked eye. Afterwards
these pieces should be slit longitudinally, and the various tissues <i>peeled
off</i> by the pupils.</p>
<p><b>BULBS AND CORMS.</b>&mdash;Bulbs of snowdrop and tulip, and corms of
crocus, can be bought from seedsmen, from September to January, at from
6d. to 1s. per 100. At any other season of the year the onion will make
a good substitute.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW TWIGS</b> will root readily if placed in water and kept near
the hot pipes in school.</p>
<p><b>VEGETABLE FINGERS.</b>&mdash;To illustrate this lesson, peas (of any
kind) ought to be grown in school. Branches of the many wild peas and
vetches are to be found in abundance in every hedgerow during spring,
summer, and autumn. Branches of Virginia creeper, clematis, trop&aelig;olum
(Indian cress) may be shown with advantage. The compound leaves of
the rose, ash, or mountain ash should be shown along with those of
sweet-pea and edible pea, and the amount of green (assimilating) area
compared.</p>
<p><b>THE GREAT WATER BEETLE</b> is found in nearly every pond.
One or two should be kept and fed upon small worms. These beetles
can also be obtained from any naturalist dealer. The larv&aelig; of this beetle
is found in ponds in summer months.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;WATER BOATMAN&rdquo; BEETLES</b> (<i><b>notonecta</b></i> and <i><b>corrixa</b></i>) are
common to all our ponds.</p>
<p><b>PLANT ARMOUR.</b>&mdash;Branches of whin, bramble, hawthorn, and
barberry, and leaves of holly, thistle, and nettle will be found to illustrate
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
this lesson. Young whin plants are to be found plentifully in spring,
growing under the old bushes. One of these should be grown in a pot
in school and kept well watered. It will produce <i>no</i> prickles.</p>
<p><b>TROUT EGGS</b> are obtainable from any of the fisheries&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Howietoun Fisheries, Stirling, or Solway Fisheries, Dumfries, at about
1s. per 100, from October till April. They are easily hatched and reared
wherever running water can be obtained. If not hatched in a bottle,
as described in Lesson XIII., the ova ought to be placed in a shallow
trough of perforated zinc suspended in a small wooden box. The inside
of the box must be charred with a red-hot iron to prevent fungal growths.
When the yolk-sac is completely absorbed, the young trout should be
fed on yolk of hard-boiled egg, and, later on, on a mixture of this and
chopped raw beef. In each case the food should be squeezed through
perforated zinc.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;SILKWORMS.&rdquo;</b>&mdash;Eggs of the silk-bearing moth (<i><b>Bombex Mori</b></i>)
can be had from Messrs Watkins &amp; Doncaster, 36 Strand, London, and
other dealers, at 4d. and 6d. per 100. The larva should be fed on mulberry
or lettuce leaves, and the leaves should never be given <i>wet</i>.</p>
<p>Caterpillars of Tiger Moth (<i><b>Arctia caja</b></i>), Emperor Moth (<i><b>Saturnia
carpini</b></i>), or Puss Moth (<i><b>Cerura vinula</b></i>) should be kept for comparison.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
